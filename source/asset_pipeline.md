# The Asset Pipeline

A web site consist of many more files than just the
HTML documents we have been generating up to now:
css files, javascript files, image files, font files, ...

The asset pipeline is rails' way of preparing
theses files for publication using the current state
of knowledge regarding web performance.

By referring to this guide, you will be able to:

- keep your assets in the right place
- have all your assets compiled and minified for production

## Web Performance

What do we mean by 'web performance'? From the viewpoint of one user,
the crucial value is the time it takes from requesting a page (by clicking a link
or button, or typing in an URL) to having the page displayed and interactive in your browser.
We will call this the 'response time'.

From the publishers point of view it might also encompass the question of
how many users you can serve (with acceptable response time) on a given
server. If you look at the question of how to serve more users in case
of more demand you enter the realm of 'scalability'. This is a more advanced
question that goes beyond the scope of this guide.

### Myths About Performance

If you have never studied this subject you might still have
an intuition about where performance problems come from.
Many beginners are fascinated by details of their programming
language like: `will using more variables make my program slower?`
or `is string concatenation faster than string interpolation?`.

These 'micro optimizations' are hardly ever necssary with modern
programming languages and computers. Using Rails, Postgres and a modern
hosting service you will have no trouble serving hundreds
of users a day and achieving adequate performance for all of them.

Trying to 'optimize' you code if there is no problem, or
if you don't know where the problem is,
will make your code worse, not better.

Donald Knuth stated this quite forcefully:

"The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; **premature optimization is the root of all evil**" -- [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth#Computer_Programming_as_an_Art_.281974.29)

Only after you have measured the performance factors that are
relevant to your project, and only after you have found out
which part of the system is causing theses factors to go over
the threshold of acceptable values, only then can you truly
start to 'optimize'.

### Measuring Web Performance

The "exceptional performance" group at Yahoo published the browser addon
`yslow` in 2007. It measures performance and displays the timing
of the different HTTP connections as a "waterfall graph":

(Image from Steve Souders [talk at Web 2.0 Expo](https://conferences.oreilly.com/web2expo/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/3321) in April 2008)

Each bar is one resource being retrieved via HTTP, the x-axis
is a common timeline for all. The most striking result you can read from
this graph: the backend is only responsible for 5% of the time in this
example! 95% of time is spent loading and parsing javascript and css files
and loading and displaying images!

This graph was later integrated into the built in developer tools
of several browsers, and into the online tool [webpagetest](https://webpagetest.org/).

### Rules...

Yahoo first published 14 rules for web performance in 2007, based
on the measurements back then:

- Make Less HTTP Requests
- Use a Content Delivery Network
- Avoid empty src or href
- Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header
- Gzip Components
- Put StyleSheets at the Top
- Put Scripts at the Bottom
- Avoid CSS Expressions...
- Make JavaScript and CSS External
- Reduce DNS Lookups
- Minify JavaScript and CSS
- Avoid Redirects
- Remove Duplicate Scripts

Even with changing browsers and
protocols some of these are still very valid today.
But as a web developer you should always keep an eye on the changing
landscape of web performance! These rules and their priority will change!

## How Rails helps with Performance

To comply with rule 1 "make fewer HTTP requests" there now exist
a lot of tools. The Rails asset pipeline was introduced in Rails 3.1 in the year 2011.

I lets you use all theses tools automatically:

- Compile to JavaScript (e.g. coffeescript, typescript, babel)
- Compile to CSS (e.g. LESS, SASS)
- Minify and combine several JavaScript files into one
- Minify and combine several CSS files into one
- Optimize images
- Create several versions of pixel images
- Create CSS Sprites
- Set Expires Header for static assets

![Asset Pipeline](images/asset-pipeline.svg)

There are two main folders:

- you put source files in `app/assets/*`
- you configure which files are built and included in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`, `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` and `app/assets/javascript/application.js`
- files for publishing are created in `public/assets/*`

The second folder will be served by the web server directly, without going through the Rails stack

### Rails Environments

The Asset Pipeline works differently in different Rails Environments.
There are three environments that exist by default:

- `development`
  - this is the environment you have been working in until now,
  - it is optimized for debugging, shows error messages and the error console.
- `testing`
  - this is used for running the [automatic tests](testing.html).
- `production`
  - this is how the finished app will run after it is published,
  - it is optimized for speed and stability.

How each envirnoments behaves is configured in files in `config/environments/*.rb`.

The development environment is used by default on your machine. If you deploy
to heroku or to another hosting server, production will be used there.

### Rails Environments and the Asset Pipeline

In `development` the asset pipeline will not write files to `public/assets`. Instead
these files will be created on the fly, and not be conactenated. The two lines
in your Layout:

```
# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
<%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
```

Will each result in a number of links. Here an example from a real project:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/search-a01b0css?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/slider-974d5css?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/static-7fe63css?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/token-input-f5febcss?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/wizzard-9a065css?body=1" />
<script src="/asset-files/jquery-4075ejs?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/jquery_ujs-f9f4ajs?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/portfolio/portfolio-78775js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/swfobject-40913js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/jquery-uploadify-702eajs?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/application-d7727js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/can-custom-c11b4js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/easySlider-6386djs?body=1"></script>
```

When you deploy to production, you deployment process will run `rake assets:precompile`,
which generates the files in `public/assets`, including `public/assets/manifest-md5hash.json`.

If you look at the generated HTML code on the production server,
you will only find two links (plus some code to handle IE 8): in production
the many css files have been concatenated into one `application*.css`, and
all JavaScript files have been concatenated into one `application*.js`:

```
<link href="/assets/application-dee0187.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" />
<!--[if lte IE 8]>
  <link href="/assets/application-ie-d369224.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<![endif]-->
<script src="/assets/application-c51a73.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

You can also try out the production environment on your own machine:

- start the web server: `rails server -e production`
- rails console: `rails console -e production`
- other rails commands: add `RAILS_ENV=production` at the beginning or the end of the command.

### Fingerprinting for better Expiry

The filenames mentioned in the last chapter all contain a part that seems random:

- you named the file `slider.css`
- but it shows up as `slider-974d585dcb6f5aec673164664a4e49d5.css`

Where do the extra characters come from and what do they mean?

These extra characters are the "fingerprint". It is computed from the full
content of the file. If only one byte changes in the file, the fingerprint will
be different.

This enables a neat trick with the expiry of the file: You can set the expiry time
to infinite, every browser can save the file forever and never try to reload it.
If the contents of the file change, a new file with a new fingerprint in the name will
be generated, and the HTML-page will link to that file.

This way we avoid one the the [two hard problems in computer science](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/506010907021828096): cache invalidation.

## Live Reloading

When you are working on the frontend of your app, fiddling
around in views and stylsheets, it may be helpful to immediatly
see the changes you make reflected in the browser.

To achieve this in Rails you can use `guard`. Add three gems to the development-section of your Gemfile:

```
group :development do
  gem 'guard'
  gem 'guard-livereload', '~> 2.5', require: false
  gem 'rack-livereload'
end
```

We are using two separate components here:

- `guard-livereload` does the actual file-watching, and runs a separate webserver on port 35729 that sends out messages when a file changes,
- `rack-livereload` adds some javascript to every webpage in your app. This javascript will connect to port 35729, listen for messages and reload the page when a message arrives.

To configure guard run:

```
bundle exec guard init livereload
```

This will create a `Guardfile` in your main directory.

Now you can start `bundle exec guard` in a separate terminal window.

To configure `rack-livereload` add the following to `config/environments/development.rb` inside the `Rails.application.configure` block:

```
config.middleware.insert_after Rack::Head, Rack::LiveReload
```

Now stop and start your webserver, reload your app in the browser, and change
a stylesheet or view to see it in action.

The window with `guard` running needs to stay open, it will look like this:

## User Generated Content

The asset pipeline handles assets that are
added by developers during development.
Images uploaded by users in production
are handled by [activestorage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html).
