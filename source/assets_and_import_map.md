The Asset Pipeline and Import Maps
===========

A web site consist of many more files than just the
HTML documents we have been generating up to now:
css files, image files, font files, javascript files, ...

The asset pipeline is rails' way of preparing
theses files for publication using the current state
of knowledge regarding web performance.

By referring to this guide, you will be able to:

- keep your assets in the right place
- have all your assets compiled and minified for production

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using external CSS and JavaScript


You can always include CSS and JavaScript code
form other sites.

```html
/* File app/views/layouts/application.html.erb */
    <title>Demo</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

There are several big CDN sites that offer many different JavaScript libraries:

* [https://www.jsdelivr.com/](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
* [https://cdnjs.com/](https://cdnjs.com/)
* [https://unpkg.com/](https://unpkg.com/)
* [https://jspm.org/](https://jspm.org/)

And there are some specialized sites:

* [https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
* [https://releases.jquery.com/](https://releases.jquery.com/)



## Web Performance

What do we mean by 'web performance'? From the viewpoint of one user,
the crucial value is the time it takes from requesting a page (by clicking a link
or button, or typing in an URL) to having the page displayed and interactive in your browser.
We will call this the 'response time'.

From the publishers point of view it might also encompass the question of
how many users you can serve (with acceptable response time) on a given
server. If you look at the question of how to serve more users in case
of more demand you enter the realm of 'scalability'. This is a more advanced
question that goes beyond the scope of this guide.

### Myths About Performance

If you have never studied this subject you might still have
an intuition about where performance problems come from.
Many beginners are fascinated by details of their programming
language like: `will using more variables make my program slower?`
or `is string concatenation faster than string interpolation?`.

These 'micro optimizations' are hardly ever necssary with modern
programming languages and computers. Using Rails, Postgres and a modern
hosting service you will have no trouble serving hundreds
of users a day and achieving adequate performance for all of them.

Trying to 'optimize' you code if there is no problem, or
if you don't know where the problem is,
will make your code worse, not better.

ยง

Donald Knuth stated this quite forcefully:

"The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; **premature optimization is the root of all evil**" -- [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth#Computer_Programming_as_an_Art_.281974.29)

Only after you have measured the performance factors that are
relevant to your project, and only after you have found out
which part of the system is causing theses factors to go over
the threshold of acceptable values, only then can you truly
start to 'optimize'.

### Measuring Web Performance

The "exceptional performance group" at Yahoo published the browser addon
`yslow` in 2007. It measures performance and displays the timing
of the different HTTP connections as a "waterfall graph":

![displaying http downloads with yslow](images/network-souders-2008.png)

(Image from Steve Souders [talk at Web 2.0 Expo](https://conferences.oreilly.com/web2expo/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/3321) in April 2008)

Each bar is one resource being retrieved via HTTP, the x-axis
is a common timeline for all. The most striking result you can read from
this graph: the backend is only responsible for 5% of the time in this
example! 95% of time is spent loading and parsing javascript and css files
and loading and displaying images!

ยง

This graph was later integrated into the built in developer tools
of several browsers, and into the online tool [webpagetest](https://webpagetest.org/).

**Firefox**

![network view in firefox](images/network-view-firefox.png)

**Chrome**

![network view in chrome](images/network-view-chrome.png)

### Rules...

Yahoo first published 14 rules for web performance in 2007, based
on the measurements back then:

- Make Less HTTP Requests
- Use a Content Delivery Network
- Avoid empty src or href
- Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header
- Gzip Components
- Put StyleSheets at the Top
- Put Scripts at the Bottom
- Avoid CSS Expressions...
- Make JavaScript and CSS External
- Reduce DNS Lookups
- Minify JavaScript and CSS
- Avoid Redirects
- Remove Duplicate Scripts

Even with changing browsers and protocols some of these are still very valid today,
while others have become less important or are not valid at all.

As a web developer you should always keep an eye on the changing
landscape of web performance!

### Less HTTP Requests?

Making less HTTP Requests was a main goal in performance optimization for many years.
Many JavaScript files were "bundled" - combined into one, the same for CSS.  Icon Fonts were used
to combine many small image files into one file.

On the other hand the HTTP protocol itself was improved again and again,
to make repeated requests to the same server "cheaper":

* [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) server HTTP requests can be multiplexed over a single TCP connection
* [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) uses UDP instead of TCP

In 2024 HTTP/3 is [supported by](https://caniuse.com/http3) all common browsers except safari and use by [about a third](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http3) of the top 10 million websites.

So today this "first rule" for avoiding HTTP requests can be relaxed.

## How Rails helps with Performance

The Rails asset pipeline was introduced in Rails 3.1 in the year 2011.
The original asset pipeline is called "sprockets" and can do the following:

- Optimize images
- Create several versions of pixel images
- transpile to CSS (e.g. SASS, LESS)
- Minify and combine several CSS files into one
- Create CSS Sprites
- transpile to JavaScript (e.g. typescript, babel, coffeescript)
- Minify and combine several JavaScript files into one

JavaScript can also be handled in other ways, we will focus on using
the asset pipeline for images and css.

![Asset Pipeline](images/asset-pipeline2.svg)

There are two main folders:

- you put source files in `app/assets/*`
- you configure which files in which sub-folder are built in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`
- if you use bundling, you define which files to include in the css bundle in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`
- if you use the asset pipeline for javascript, you define which files to include in the js bundle in  `app/assets/javascript/application.js`
- files for publishing are created in `public/assets/*`

ยง

The `public` folder contains static files only. It will be served by the web server directly, without going through the Rails stack.

![diagram showing how static files are served by the webserver directly, without rails](images/rails-mvc.svg)

The expires header for the files in `public/assets/` should be set to a far future date.

### Rails Environments

The Asset Pipeline works differently in different Rails Environments.
There are three environments that exist by default:

- `development`
  - this is the environment you have been working in until now,
  - it is optimized for debugging, shows error messages and the error console.
- `testing`
  - this is used for running the [automatic tests](testing.html).
- `production`
  - this is how the finished app will run after it is published,
  - it is optimized for speed and stability.

How each environment behaves is configured in files in `config/environments/*.rb`.

The development environment is used by default on your machine. If you deploy
your app to a webserver, production will be used there.

### development Environment and the Asset Pipeline

In `development` the asset pipeline will not write files to `public/assets`. Instead
these files will be created on the fly, and not be conactenated. The two lines
in your Layout:

```
# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
<%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
```

Will each result in a number of links. Here an example from a real project:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/search-a01b0css?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/slider-974d5css?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/static-7fe63css?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/token-input-f5febcss?body=1" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/asset-files/wizzard-9a065css?body=1" />
<script src="/asset-files/jquery-4075ejs?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/jquery_ujs-f9f4ajs?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/portfolio/portfolio-78775js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/swfobject-40913js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/jquery-uploadify-702eajs?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/application-d7727js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/can-custom-c11b4js?body=1"></script>
<script src="/asset-files/easySlider-6386djs?body=1"></script>
```


### production Environment and the Asset Pipeline


When you deploy to production, you deployment process will run `rake assets:precompile`,
which generates the files in `public/assets`, including `public/assets/manifest-md5hash.json`.

If you look at the generated HTML code on the production server,
you will only find two links (plus some code to handle IE 8): in production
the many css files have been concatenated into one `application*.css`, and
all JavaScript files have been concatenated into one `application*.js`:

```
<link href="/assets/application-dee0187.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" />
<!--[if lte IE 8]>
  <link href="/assets/application-ie-d369224.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<![endif]-->
<script src="/assets/application-c51a73.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

### Fingerprinting for better Expiry

The filenames mentioned in the last chapter all contain a part that seems random:

- you named the file `slider.css`
- but it shows up as `slider-974d585dcb6f5aec673164664a4e49d5.css`

Where do the extra characters come from and what do they mean?

These extra characters are the "fingerprint". It is computed as a hash from the full
content of the file. If only one byte changes in the file, the fingerprint will
be different.

ยง

Let's look at the effect that fingerprinting  has on caching:

- I create a file `slider.css`
- the asset pipeline publishes it as `slider-abc.css`  (simplified) and an expiry date in the year 2099
- rails displays the webpage with a `link rel=stylesheet` tag that points at `slider-abc.css`
- a browser loads the page for the first time, loads  `slider-abc.css` and keeps this version of the file forever

If the same user comes back to my webpage a year later, the browser will load
the new html page. this will still contain a `link rel=stylesheet` tag that points at `slider-abc.css`.
`slider-abc.css` is still in the browser cache, this will be used. No need to load it.

ยง

Another year later I change something in slider.css and deploy the web application again.
Now what happens:

- I edit the file `slider.css`
- the asset pipeline publishes it as `slider-xyz.css`  (simplified) and an expiry date in the year 2101
- rails displays the webpage with a link rel=stylesheet tag that points at `slider-xyz.css`

Now if a user comes back to my website, their browser will see a new URL for the style sheet.
The cached style `slider-abc.css` is ignored, the new file `slider-xyz.css` will be loaded
and added to the cache.


This way we automatically handle one the the [two hard problems in computer science](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/506010907021828096): cache invalidation.

### Using assets in your views

To include the concatenated and fingerprinted css file, use this in your layout:

```erb
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application" %>
```

To use an image `example.svg` stored in `app/assets/images/example.svg` use

```erb
     <%= image_tag 'example.svg ' %>
```


## Example setups

### Using bootstrap

If you want to use bootstrap for your project it makes
sense to also use sass. This way you can set SASS-Variables
that will be used by bootstrap.

So to prepare your project for using bootstrap install these two gems:

* sassc-rails
* bootstrap

This will install the bootstrap sass files in your asset pipeline.
You should remove `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`  and create
`application.sass` instead.

Now you can use sass to import bootstrap, and to set variables
that influence bootstrap:

```sass
/* file app/assets/stylesheets/application.sass */

/* Sass variable overrides - before importing bootstrap */

$enable-shadows: true;
$enable-rounded: true;

@import "bootstrap";

/* CSS custom properties override - after importing bootstrap */

:root {
  --bs-body-bg: #fff58b;
}
```


### Using fonts

To use fonts in the asset pipeline first create a `fonts` directory
in `app/assets`.  This is where you can store your `*.woff2` files.

In `app/config/manifest.js` you need to add

```
//= link_tree ../fonts
```

Now you can use these font files in your stylesheets.
But beware: the font files will get new filenames because of the fingerprints.

So instead of writing

```
/* file fonts.css */
@font-face {
  font-family: "stardos_stencil";
  src:
    "../fonts/stardosstencil-bold-webfont.woff2"
    format("woff2"),
    "../fonts/stardosstencil-bold-webfont.woff"
    format("woff");
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: bold;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

You need to use the method `font_path`.  This also implies naming
the stylesheet `.css.erb` so that ruby can be used:

```
/* file fonts.css.erb */
@font-face {
  font-family: "stardos_stencil";
  src:
    url("<%= font_path('stardosstencil-bold-webfont.woff2') %>"
    format("woff2"),
    url("<%= font_path('stardosstencil-bold-webfont.woff') %>"
    format("woff");
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: bold;
  font-display: swap;
}
```


## User Generated Content

The asset pipeline handles assets that are
added by developers during development.
Images uploaded by users in production
are handled by [activestorage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html).


## JavaScript

JavaScript can be added to an application in several different ways.


### Using JavaScript with import maps

Make sure you have the gem `importmap-rails` in your Gemfile or add it with `bundle add importmap-rails`.

If you already have a file `bin/importmap` you are all set up.  If not, you need to run this once:

```console
rails importmap:install
```

ยง

From now on you can add npm packages for the frontend with `importmap pin`. For example:

```console
$ bin/importmap pin unicode-emoji-picker
Pinning "unicode-emoji-picker" to vendor/javascript/unicode-emoji-picker.js via download from https://ga.jspm.io/npm:unicode-emoji-picker@1.3.9/index.js
Pinning "scrollable-component" to vendor/javascript/scrollable-component.js via download from https://ga.jspm.io/npm:scrollable-component@1.2.1/index.js
Pinning "unicode-emoji" to vendor/javascript/unicode-emoji.js via download from https://ga.jspm.io/npm:unicode-emoji@2.5.0/index.js
```

Here I requested one module, but it came with two dependencies. All three modules
were downloaded do my machine and added to the folder `vendor/javascript`.

See the file `config/importmap.rb` for the complete list of pinned imports.

The files from `/vendor/javascript` are handled like other assets: they
will get a new filename with a fingerprint and in production
they will be copied to `public/assets/`.

ยง

In `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` you use


```erb
<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
```

If you look at the generated html code of your app you will find several
new JavaScript features at work:

```html
<script type="importmap" data-turbo-track="reload">{
  "imports": {
    "application": "/assets/application-d8a8613a.js",
    "unicode-emoji-picker": "/assets/unicode-emoji-picker-c8299061.js",
    "scrollable-component": "/assets/scrollable-component-a8230eb7.js",
    "unicode-emoji": "/assets/unicode-emoji-d50af150.js"
  }
}</script>
<link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/application-d8a8613a.js">
<link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/unicode-emoji-picker-c8299061.js">
<link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/scrollable-component-a8230eb7.js">
<link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/unicode-emoji-d50af150.js">
<script type="module">import "application"</script>
```

ยง

A script tag with type importmap can define "bare" names for importing JavaScript modules.
So instead of writing

```
import "https://myapp.at/assets/unicode-emoji-picker-c8299061.js";
```

we can now use the bare module name:

```
import "unicode-emoji-picker";
```

The link tags with rel `modulpreload` tell the browser to load these files
as soon as possible, so they will be available when an import-statment is encountered.

### Writing your own JavaScript modules

The entrypoint for you own JavaScript is `app/javascript/application.js`.

From there you import and call you own modules:

```js
import Emoji from "src/emoji";

// all the code that needs to run after DOMContentLoaded:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  Emoji(document);
})
```

Here a module src/emoji.js is imported.  This file also needs
to be "pinned". You can do this for all the files in `app/javascript/src` at once with

```rb
pin_all_from 'app/javascript/src', under: 'src'
```

In emoji.js you can import the module "unicode-emoji-picker" by referencing it by it's bare name:

```js
import "unicode-emoji-picker";

function Emoji(scope) {
  const picker = scope.querySelector('unicode-emoji-picker');
  picker.addEventListener('emoji-pick', (event) => {
      let emoji = event.detail.emoji;
      console.log(emoji);
    });
  }
}

export default Emoji;
```


### Importmaps and Caching

When the app is deployed, the javascript file will be published with fingerprints:

```
/assets/application-d8a8613a.js
/assets/unicode-emoji-picker-c8299061.js
/assets/scrollable-component-a8230eb7.js
/assets/unicode-emoji-d50af150.js
````

But when you look inside the files, they reference other modules by their
bare names.

Dependencies need to be updated regularly to stay ahead of security problems.
You can do this with `importmap`:

```console
$ bin/importmap outdated
| Package              | Current | Latest |
|----------------------|---------|--------|
| unicode-emoji-picker | 1.3.9   | 1.4.0  |
  1 outdated package found

$ bin/importmap update
Pinning "unicode-emoji-picker" to vendor/javascript/unicode-emoji-picker.js via download from https://ga.jspm.io/npm:unicode-emoji-picker@1.4.0/index.js
```

With this update the file `vendor/javascript/unicode-emoji-picker.js` has changed. This
will result in a new fingerprint.  Browsers that already have the other javascript
file in cache will only need to load on new file.

(Contrast this to classic "JavaScript bundling" where all files are concatenated into one
giant bundle, and every change leads to reloading the whole bundle.)
