Architectures
=========================

With the proliferation of frontend frameworks
you get to choose between many possible architectures 
for your web app.

After working through this guide you should

* have an overview of possible architecures
* be able to chose an architectures

-------------------------------------------------------------


Examples
------------

Here are some possible architectures.  In all of these
scenarios Ruby on Rails  can be replaced by another web frameworks -
be it Laravel in PHP or something based on node.js or....

* Rails app is backend only, javascript is used sparingly, for "decoration" purposes only.
* One Rails "backend page" is the host to several "frontend pages"
   * the data is sent to the frontend
      * when the html is first generated, e.g. through data attributes
      * through separate ajax requests.  the html can be cached for all users, personalization only occurse through the ajax data
   * every frontend page can also be rendered on the backend if needed (e.g. react)
* The frontend app is  a "one page app", rails supplies the REST API that contains the business logic and anything 
there are also many options withouth rails:
* the frontend app is a "one page app", the backend is mostly stupid (firebase, couchdb) except for authenticaiton and permissions
* frontend and backend are generated by the same frameworks, e.g. meteor
