# APIs

After working through this guide you will:

- know about the thinking behind GraphQL APIs
- be able to configure your existing Rails App to offer a GraphQL API


---

## What is an API

API stands for "Application Programming Interface". It is a set of clearly defined methods
of communication with a software component. So the objects and methods exposed by a library
form an API.

In Web development the acronym API is most
commonly used when the software component in question runs on a different server on the
Internet and is accessed via HTTP.


## SOAP, REST and GraphQL

Currently three main API styles are used on the Web:

* SOAP, designed 1998 at Mircosoft, uses XML and POST requests to make "remote procedure calls"
* REST, described in 2000, uses different HTTP Methods and Status Messages to access "resources"
* GraphQL, released 2015 by Facebook, uses POST requests, it's only query language and JSON

This Guide is concerned with GraphQL, there is a second guide for [REST](/rest-api.html). SOAP
is rearely offered with Rails, but there is a [soap client](https://github.com/savonrb/savon) in
ruby.

## API layer is a separate layer

Please note that any of the API styles can be used
with any backend, frontend, persistance layers: 

* You can build a REST in front of a PHP backend using MongoDB as the database and use it from a frontend written with jQuery. 
* You can build a GraphQL API for a Rails backend using MySQL as the database and build the frontend with React.

That's kind of the point of an API: to allow different technologies
on both sides of the API.


## GraphQL

REST and SOAP APIs are fixed interfaces: each api call has a fixed set of
arguments and returns a fixed data structure.  All decisions are made when
specifying the API.

GraphQL shifts some decisions to the client: through a Query Language the client
can request data in the specific shape it needs, within the limits that the
API sets. 

### Query Language

A simple example with two models: a project has many URLs. when querying
through GraphQL you can request different attributes of both models:

![1:n relationship in the database](images/two-queries.gif)

Notice how the resulting JSON data mirrors the structure of the query.
The query language is used for both Queries (getting data) and Mutations (changing
data).

### Introspection and Playground

A GraphQL API can always be queried to give information
about the possible queries, mutations and types.  This is called
introspection.

The GraphQL Playground is a Web App that enables you to
make Queries and Mutations.  It uses introspection to display
documentation and to offer autocompletion:

  <source src="images/autocomplete.mov" type="video/quicktime" />
  <source src="images/autocomplete.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

###  Types

A GraphQL delivers JSON, which only has objects, arrays, strings, numbers and null 
as types.  But GraphQL itself can build a more detailed type system and check
these types in queries and mutations.



### basic example

example query:

```
{
  cityZone(id: "2349ksj0342" ) {
    id
    url
  }
}
```

a possible resonse

```
{
  "data": {
    "cityZone": {
      "id": "2349ksj0342",
      "url": "wuppertal"
    }
  }
}
```

### how the server handles the request

- parse query
- validate with schema
- resolve data
- convert response to JSON

### aggragate

### pagination

### mutation and response

### errors

### versioning, deprecation



## Using Rails to build a GraphQL API

To add a GraphQL API to an existing Rails app you need just two gems:

```
gem 'graphql'
group :development do
  gem 'graphql-rails-generators'
end
```

The rest of the setup is handled by a generator added by the `graphql` gem:

```
rails generate graphql:install
       exist  app/graphql/types
      create  app/graphql/types/.keep
      create  app/graphql/portfolio_relaunch_schema.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_object.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_argument.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_field.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_enum.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_input_object.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_interface.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_scalar.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/base_union.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/query_type.rb
add_root_type  query
      create  app/graphql/mutations
      create  app/graphql/mutations/.keep
      create  app/graphql/mutations/base_mutation.rb
      create  app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb
add_root_type  mutation
      create  app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
       route  post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"
     gemfile  graphiql-rails
       route  graphiql-rails
Gemfile has been modified, make sure you `bundle install`
```

After running bundle and restarting the server you can
access the graphql playground at `http://localhost:3000/graphiql`:
in the left pane you can enter a query, run it, and see the
result in the middle pane.  The right pane contains documentation
that was created automatically.

![GraphQL Playground](images/graphql-playground.png)

We have no Queries to run yet.  As a first step we can
use a generator to create a type from an existing model:

```
rails generate gql:model_type Project
      create  app/graphql/types/project_type.rb
```

Now edit the type to fit your needs:

```
module Types
  class ProjectType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, GraphQL::Types::ID, null: false
    field :title, String, null: false
    field :publicationdate, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601Date, null: false
    field :membership, Int, null: true
    field :created_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: false
    field :updated_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: false
    field :slug, String, null: false
  end
end
```

The next level up we come to the query.  There is already
a dummy Query in `app/graphql/types/query_type.rb`

```
module Types
  class QueryType < Types::BaseObject
    # Add root-level fields here.
    # They will be entry points for queries on your schema.

    # TODO: remove me
    field :test_field, String, null: false,
      description: "An example field added by the generator"
    def test_field
      "Hello World!"
    end
  end
end
```

We can replace it with a query that returns a list of all projects:

```
module Types
  class QueryType < Types::BaseObject
    field :all_projects, [ProjectType], 
      null: false,
      description: "a list of all publicly visible projects"
    def all_projects
      "Hello World!"
    end
  end
end
```

and run the query in the playground. Your query will be autocompleted.

<video controls autoplay>
  <source src="images/autocomplete.mov" type="video/quicktime" />
  <source src="images/autocomplete.mp4" type="video/mp4" />  
  ![GraphQL Playground](images/graphql-playground.png)
</video>

### Queries with arguments

```
    field :project, ProjectType, null: true do
      argument :id, ID, required: true
    end
    def project(id:)
      Project.visible.find(id)
    end
```

### Relationships between models

![1:n relationship in the database](images/graphql-project-has-many-urls.png)


```
    field :project, ProjectType, null: true do
      argument :id, ID, required: true
    end
    def project(id:)
      Project.visible.find(id)
    end
```

generate the UlrType automatically from the model:


```
module Types
  class UrlType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, GraphQL::Types::ID, null: false
    field :title, String, null: true
    field :url, String, null: true
    field :url_type, String, null: true
    field :created_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: true
    field :updated_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: true
  end
end
````

add the queries `all_urls` and `url` to  `app/graphql/types/query_type.rb`

add the field `urls` to `app/graphql/types/project_type.rb`:

```
module Types
  class ProjectType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, GraphQL::Types::ID, null: false
    field :title, String, null: false
    field :publicationdate, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601Date, null: false
    field :membership, Int, null: true
    field :created_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: false
    field :updated_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: false
    field :slug, String, null: false
    field :urls, [UrlType], null: false
  end
end
```


now you can query for Urls directly or though their project:


![query a 1:n relationship with graphql](images/graphql-query-relationship.png)


Thought Experiment: what would you need to do, to make a query 
from Url to Project possible?

``` 
{
  url(id:2077){
    id
    url
    urlType
    title
    project {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

Answer: add a field project to UrlType:

```
module Types
  class UrlType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, GraphQL::Types::ID, null: false
    field :title, String, null: true
    field :url, String, null: true
    field :url_type, String, null: true
    field :created_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: true
    field :updated_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: true
    field :project, ProjectType, null: false
  end
end
```

### Types 

In Ruby and JavaScript we often use Strings to store all
kinds of values.   In the example
above, `Url.url_type` only has three possible values: 'Link','Repository','Award'.

In GraphQL you can define a Type for that:

```
rails g graphql:enum UrlTypeEnum Link Repository Award
      create  app/graphql/types/url_type_enum_type.rb
```

```
module Types
  class UrlTypeEnumType < Types::BaseEnum
    value "Link"
    value "Repository"
    value "Award"
  end
end
```

This can now be used in `UrlType`:


```
module Types
  class UrlType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, GraphQL::Types::ID, null: false
    field :title, String, null: true
    field :url, String, null: true
    field :url_type, UrlTypeEnumType, null: true
    field :created_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: true
    field :updated_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: true
    field :project, ProjectType, null: false
  end
end
```


The data returned by a query is still JSON, and cannot contain
enums, only Strings. 

![querying an enum gives a string](images/graphql-enum.png)



In the documentation you can see that
only three Strings are valid.  The GraphQL API will 
validate this both in Queries and in Mutations.
